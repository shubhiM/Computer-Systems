Compute exponential function using a master-worker architecture:

Please refer to the following link for detailed description:

MAKEFILE commands:

Steps to run the master worker project.
1. make check - executes both make clean and make build sequentially


run the project using the following command

For master (you can pass the arguments in arbitrary order)
./master --worker_path ./worker --num_workers 5 --wait_mechanism MECHANISM
-x 2 -n 12

Here MECHANISM can hold select/epoll (case sensitive)

output of the master process would be "result: <total sum>"

For worker (arguments can be passed in any order)
./worker -x 2 -n 3


LIMITATION:
The program has been stress tested for 1000 terms maximum, after that there is
OS limit of opened file descriptors (1024) and program halts giving error as
too many open file descriptors.
